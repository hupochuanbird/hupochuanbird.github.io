      <description>The main content of this article is to use the Sonic engine to enable Flarum to search Chinese as well.
In my Flarum, the search module isn&amp;rsquo;t perfect enough so far, almost all the discussions are using Chinese, so the default search module doesn&amp;rsquo;t work. Here, in this section, I primarily focus on utilizing the Sonic extension to implement Chinese text search. In my case, the server-side encounters some errors.</description>

      <title>Flarum Connects to AWS RDs</title>

      <description>For the majority tutorial, the flarum always connects with the localhost db directly. However, base on my knowledge, once the server shutdown or reboot, the data could be lost, also it&amp;rsquo;s not easy to debug(although flaurm has logs files to record all errors). So I suppose that separate db and flaurm server.
In this section, I use AWS EC2 and RDs to implement my solution.
For how to deploy the Flarum in EC2, I will write author article, but to be honest, it&amp;rsquo;s the common way for deploying to any other Linux server.</description>
