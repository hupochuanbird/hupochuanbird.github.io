      <description>„Äê2428„ÄëMaximum Sum of an Hourglass Medium You are given an m x n integer matrix grid.
We define an hourglass as a part of the matrix with the following form:
Return the maximum sum of the elements of an hourglass.
Note that an hourglass cannot be rotated and must be entirely contained within the matrix.
Example 1:
Input: grid = [[6,2,1,3],[4,2,1,5],[9,2,8,7],[4,1,2,9]] Output: 30 Explanation: The cells shown above represent the hourglass with the maximum sum: 6 &amp;#43; 2 &amp;#43; 1 &amp;#43; 2 &amp;#43; 9 &amp;#43; 2 &amp;#43; 8 = 30.</description>

      <description>„Äê2225„ÄëFind Players With Zero or One Losses Medium You are given an integer array matches where matches[i] = [winneri, loseri] indicates that the player winneri defeated player loseri in a match.
Return a list answer of size 2 where:
answer[0] is a list of all players that have not lost any matches. answer[1] is a list of all players that have lost exactly one match. The values in the two lists should be returned in increasing order.</description>

      <description>üíô „Äê2133„ÄëCheck if Every Row and Column Contains All Numbers easy An n x n matrix is valid if every row and every column contains all the integers from 1 to n (inclusive).
Given an n x n integer matrix matrix, return true if the matrix is valid. Otherwise, return false.
Example 1:
Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[3,1,2],[2,3,1]] Output: true Explanation: In this case, n = 3, and every row and column contains the numbers 1, 2, and 3.</description>
